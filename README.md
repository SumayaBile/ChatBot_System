## Chatbot with Tkinter

This project implements a simple chatbot using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and regular expressions (regex) for pattern matching. The chatbot can respond to predefined user inputs with helpful replies, making it suitable for basic customer support use cases.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Tkinter:** Used for creating the GUI interface where users can interact with the chatbot.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex):** Utilized to match patterns in user input and provide appropriate responses.
- **Pattern Matching:** The chatbot recognizes specific keywords or phrases and responds accordingly.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
3. Run the script `chatbot.py`:

```bash
python chatbot.py

User Interaction
Type a message in the input field.

Press the "Send" button or hit "Enter" to submit your message.

The chatbot will respond based on predefined patterns and provide helpful answers.

** 🛠️ Requirements **
Python 3.x

Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

No additional installation is required for Tkinter, as it's part of the standard Python library.

** ⚙️ How It Works **
User Input: The chatbot listens for user input from the text field and matches the input with pre-defined patterns using regex.

Responses: Once a match is found, the chatbot generates an appropriate response based on the matched pattern.

GUI Interaction: The GUI is built using Tkinter, displaying messages from both the user and the bot, with a scrollable text area.

** 🖼️ Output **
When you run the script, a window will appear where:

You can type your message.

The chatbot will respond with a relevant reply based on the message.

Conversations are displayed in the scrollable text area.
